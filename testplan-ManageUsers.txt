# Test Plan Outline for Manual / Exploratory testing of SnippetSentry 'Manage Users' Features

## 1. Introduction
- Purpose: To verify the functionality of user Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) features in the UI.
- URL:  https://beta.snippetsentry.com/app/client/users
- Scope: Covers functional, UI, and edge case testing for user management.

## 2. Assumptions

- The application is deployed in a stable environment with no ongoing maintenance or updates during testing.
- Test data used for validation is pre-approved and does not conflict with existing data in the system.
- All required backend services and APIs are functional and accessible.
- The browser and device used for testing meet the application's minimum requirements.

## 3. Test Scenarios

### 3.1 User Creation
